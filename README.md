## Introduction



If you are a beginner in spatial data science, you will find interesting books here:
 - [Spatial Data Science with applications in R](https://www.r-spatial.org/book)
 - [Spatial Data Science with R and “terra”](https://rspatial.org/terra/)
 - [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)
 - [sf tutorials](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/), and [stars tutorials](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/articles/)
 - [Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis](https://pythongis.org/)
 - [Geocomputation with Python](https://geocompr.github.io/py/)

## Requirements

**Hardware:**

Your hardware should have a minimum of 8 GB RAM.
In case you do not have access to such a configuration, there is a small raster file in the "data" folder, which can be used for this workshop.
The operating system is arbitrary, but make sure all packages are working properly.

**Software:**

 - **R**: R, RStudio, sf, stars, terra, bench, microbenchmark
 - **Python**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, geopandas, rasterio

If possible, you should use the latest software versions.

## Materials

 - [R](https://kadyb.github.io/OGH2022/R.html)
 - Python

To start Jupyter Notebook, type in the terminal (or Anaconda Prompt):

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then it will launch the environment in your web browser.
